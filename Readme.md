## Using the Plugin

### System permissions

<<<<<<< HEAD
For your Android app, you will need to grant the following permissions.
=======
For your Android app, the following permissions will be requested to the user:
>>>>>>> master

  - **ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION**: Used to provide the positioning system
  - **ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION**: Used to provide the positioning system
  - **WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE**: Used to store all the info required by the module

For your iOS app you have to provide the following permissions

  - **NSLocationAlwaysUsageDescription**
    A message that tells the user why the app is requesting access to the userâ€™s location information while the app is running in the foreground.

  - **NSLocationAlwaysUsageDescription**
    A message that tells the user why the app is requesting access to the user's location at all times.

  - **NSBluetoothPeripheralUsageDescription**
    A message that tells the user why the app is requesting the ability to connect to Bluetooth peripherals.

  - **NSBluetoothAlwaysUsageDescription** (Only if you are targeting iOS13.0 or superior)
    A message that tells the user why the app needs access to Bluetooth.


### API key (Android and iOS platforms)

  You can specify your API keys in `config.xml` file.

  ```xml
    <preference name="GOOGLE_MAPS_ANDROID_API_KEY" value="YOUR_GOOGLE_MAPS_ANDROID_KEY"/>
    <preference name="GOOGLE_MAPS_IOS_API_KEY" value="YOUR_GOOGLE_MAPS_IOS_KEY"/>
    <preference name="SITUM_USER" value="YOUR_SITUM_USER"/>
    <preference name="SITUM_API_KEY" value="YOUR_SITUM_APIKEY"/>
    <preference name="SITUM_BUILDING_ID" value="YOUR_BUILDING_ID"/>
  ```

### Accessing plugin object

When the device ready event is fired, global cordova variable is injected in namespace. Plugins are available in this variable: plugin.situm.wayfinding.situmWayfindingPlugin. The Situm Cordova Plugin is autowired within this object.

So, all methods are called in the same way, e.g. 'load':

```javascript
  plugin.situm.wayfinding.situmWayfindingPlugin.load(map_div, settings, function(success) {},function(error) {});
```

### Methods

#### - load

Load SitumWayfinding in the specified div. For more info about the settings object, you can [visit the documentation](https://developers.situm.es/sdk_documentation/wayfinding/javadoc/es/situm/wayfinding/LibrarySettings.html).

```javascript
  let librarySettings = {
          'dashboardUrl': 'https://dashboard.situm.es',
          'hasSearchView': true,
          'searchViewPlaceholder': 'Cordova Wayfinding',
          'useDashboardTheme': false
        };

  load("div_id_where_to_place_plugin", "librarySettings", "success_callback", "error_callback");
```

This method returns a plugin object.

** IMPORTANT NOTE** The settings parameter, as the time of writing, is only used by the Android platform. It does not create problems if they are used for the iOS platform, they will be silently ignored.

#### - unload

Unload SitumWayfinding plugin_object.

```javascript
  unload("plugin_object", "success_callback", "error_callback")
```

## Limitations

* Using the "Go back" button in iOS will block the module for the user. It will be fixed in coming releases.
* The methods load and unload should be called in that order and only once. Multiple calls to the same method without calling the other first will result in unexpected failure.

## Generating JSDoc

The JSDoc is avaible in both, in [Situm Developers Page](http://developers.situm.es/sdk_documentation/wayfinding/jsdoc/latest/SitumWayfindingPlugin.html). and into this project docs folder. However if you want to regenerate JSDoc by yourself, you need to install *Toast UI JSDoc template* via npm. To do it, in the plugin root:

```
npm install
npm i -D tui-jsdoc-template
```

And then generate the documentation:
```
npm run jsdoc
```
