## Using the Plugin

### System permission

For your iOS app you have to provide the following permissions

  - **NSLocationAlwaysUsageDescription**
    A message that tells the user why the app is requesting access to the userâ€™s location information while the app is running in the foreground.

  - **NSLocationAlwaysUsageDescription**
    A message that tells the user why the app is requesting access to the user's location at all times.

  - **NSBluetoothPeripheralUsageDescription**
    A message that tells the user why the app is requesting the ability to connect to Bluetooth peripherals.

  - **NSBluetoothAlwaysUsageDescription** (Only if you are targeting iOS13.0 or superior)
    A message that tells the user why the app needs access to Bluetooth.


### API key (Android and iOS platforms)

  You can specify your API keys in `config.xml` file.

  ```xml
    <preference name="GOOGLE_MAPS_IOS_API_KEY" value="YOUR_GOOGLE_MAPS_IOS_KEY"/>
    <preference name="SITUM_USER" value="YOUR_SITUM_USER"/>
    <preference name="SITUM_API_KEY" value="YOUR_SITUM_APIKEY"/>
    <preference name="SITUM_BUILDING_ID" value="YOUR_BUILDING_ID"/>
  ```

### Accessing plugin object

When the device ready event is fired, global cordova variable is injected in namespace. Plugins are available in this variable: plugin.situm.wayfinding.situmWayfindingPlugin. The Situm Cordova Plugin is autowired within this object.

So, all methods are called in the same way, e.g. 'load':

```javascript
  plugin.situm.wayfinding.situmWayfindingPlugin.load(map_div, function(success) {},function(error) {});
```

### Methods

#### - load

Load SitumWayfinding in the specified div. 

```javascript
  load("div_id_where_to_place_plugin", "success_callback", "error_callback");
```

This method returns and plugin object.

#### - unload

Unload SitumWayfinding plugin_object.

```javascript
  unload("plugin_object", "success_callback", "error_callback")
```

## Generating JSDoc

The JSDoc is avaible in both, in [Situm Developers Page](http://developers.situm.es/sdk_documentation/wayfinding/jsdoc/latest/SitumWayfindingPlugin.html). and into this project docs folder. However if you want to regenerate JSDoc by yourself, you need to install *Toast UI JSDoc template* via npm. To do it, in the plugin root:

```
npm install
npm i -D tui-jsdoc-template
``` 

And then generate the documentation:
```
npm run jsdoc
```
